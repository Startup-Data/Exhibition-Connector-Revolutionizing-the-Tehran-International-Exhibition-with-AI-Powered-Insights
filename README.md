# Exhibition Connector: Revolutionizing the Tehran International Exhibition with AI-Powered Insights

## Introduction
The Tehran International Exhibition is a premier platform for showcasing advancements in civil engineering, technology, and trade, connecting businesses globally. **Exhibition Connector**, accessible at [expoconnector.ir](https://expoconnector.ir), transforms this experience with an AI-powered platform that streamlines preparation, enhances networking, and delivers data-driven strategies. At its core is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot**, dubbed â€œCharbichick RAG LLM,â€ which processes exhibitor data from XLS files and a comprehensive PDF ebook to provide tailored insights and facilitate collaboration.

## Project Overview
Exhibition Connector is designed to empower exhibitors at the Tehran International Exhibition by automating key tasks and fostering meaningful connections. The platform integrates advanced AI technologies, including Hugging Face models and a custom RAG-based chatbot, to deliver:
- **Personalized Reports**: Business plans, market analyses, feasibility studies, and pitch decks tailored to each companyâ€™s needs.
- **Intelligent Meeting Scheduling**: Pre-exhibition meetings arranged 1â€“3 weeks in advance, matching companies based on compatibility.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Strategic recommendations derived from market trends and company data.
- **Digital Resources**: A PDF ebook of the exhibition and an XLS database, processed by the RAG chatbot for real-time query responses.

The platformâ€™s focus on civil engineering and trade aligns with the exhibitionâ€™s mission to drive innovation and international collaboration.

### Key Features
1. **Charbichick RAG AI Chatbot**  
   - **Functionality**: Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from an XLS file (containing exhibitor data) and a PDF ebook (detailing the exhibitionâ€™s structure, sessions, and opportunities). It combines this data with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, context-aware responses to exhibitor queries.  
   - **Use Cases**: Answers questions about market opportunities, suggests potential partners, and provides event logistics (e.g., booth locations, schedules).  
   - **Example Interaction**: An exhibitor asks, â€œWhat companies offer construction equipment?â€ The chatbot retrieves relevant entries from the XLS and ebook, responding with a list of matched companies and their booth numbers.

2. **Automated Report Generation**  
   - Produces customized documents, including:  
     - **Business Plans**: Strategies to align with exhibitor goals.  
     - **Market Analyses**: Insights into trends and competitive landscapes.  
     - **Pitch Decks**: Professional presentations for investors and partners.  
   - Reports are generated using AI models, ensuring precision and relevance.

3. **Intelligent Meeting Scheduling**  
   - **Pre-Exhibition Networking**: Schedules meetings 1â€“3 weeks before the event, fostering early connections.  
   - **Smart Matching**: Uses AI to pair companies based on shared interests, products, or markets.  
   - **Efficiency**: Ensures exhibitors arrive with established relationships, maximizing event impact.

4. **PDF Ebook and XLS Integration**  
   - **PDF Ebook**: A comprehensive digital guide to the Tehran International Exhibition, covering exhibitor profiles, event schedules, and industry insights. Available for download and integrated with the RAG chatbot for query support.  
   - **XLS Database**: A structured file containing exhibitor details (e.g., company name, products, contact info), used by the chatbot to provide real-time data.  
   - **Accessibility**: Both resources are accessible via the platform, enhancing exhibitor preparation.

## Sample Exhibitor Data (Fictional)
To illustrate how Exhibition Connector processes company information, below is a table of two fictional companies participating in the Tehran International Exhibition. This data is stored in the XLS file and used by the RAG chatbot:

| Company Name           | CEO               | Representative   | Mobile          | Telephone   | Requested Area | City   | Product Categories                       |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Ù†ÙˆÛŒÙ† Ø³Ø§Ø²Ù‡ Ù¾Ø§Ø±Ø³        | Ø¹Ù„ÛŒ Ù…Ø­Ù…Ø¯ÛŒ         | Ø³Ø§Ø±Ø§ Ø­Ø³ÛŒÙ†ÛŒ       | 09123456789     | 2187654321  | 120.0          | ØªÙ‡Ø±Ø§Ù†  | ØªØ¬Ù‡ÛŒØ²Ø§Øª Ø³Ø§Ø®ØªÙ…Ø§Ù†ÛŒ Ùˆ Ù…ØµØ§Ù„Ø­ Ù†ÙˆÛŒÙ†           |

*Note: These are fictional examples for illustrative purposes, as requested.*

## How the RAG AI Chatbot Works
The **Charbichick RAG LLM** is a cornerstone of Exhibition Connector, combining retrieval and generation capabilities:
- **Data Sources**:  
  - **XLS File**: Contains structured exhibitor data (e.g., company names, product categories, contact details).  
  - **PDF Ebook**: A digital guide with unstructured content about the exhibition, including session details and industry trends.  
- **Retrieval Process**: When a user queries the chatbot (e.g., â€œWhich companies offer sustainable construction solutions?â€), it searches the XLS and PDF for relevant information, extracting matching entries.  
- **Generation Process**: The LLM generates a natural language response, synthesizing retrieved data with contextual understanding (e.g., â€œÙÙ†Ø§ÙˆØ±ÛŒ Ø¹Ù…Ø±Ø§Ù† Ø³Ø¨Ø² offers sustainable construction solutions at Booth 12.â€).  
- **Benefits**: Provides instant, accurate answers, reducing manual research and enhancing exhibitor efficiency.
